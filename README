Briefly about the project:

With iCubes platform you can add different properties and features to real objects 
and interact with them in virtual space. You can "write" characters, numbers, words 
or even chemical elements on a simple colored cube, and with help of a simple 
web-camera, platform tracks its location. Based on a set of rules and input 
information the cube is being transformed into an object in virtual space.

The platform id design in a way that any user can add their own plug-in without
modifying the source code of the platform

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At program launch, ICUBES instance is created. in ICUBES class constructor there is 
all module initialization. Recognition module routines are started by invoking 
BEGIN_READ () which launches separate thread on which to read from video stream. 
This is made so to separate GUI and processing routines. Signals (Events) are used
to notify other classes about quadrilaterals recognized/processed. It is strongly
recommended to make conversation with colleagues before extending basic interface.

Simple process scheme:

App. launch:
 1) Main window created
	2) Logic/Recognition modules initialized

Frames processing routines:
	1) Reading video stream on separate thread
	2) After quadrilaterls recognized, according signal must be invoked (passing to it recognized quadrilaterals),
	to notify other classes.

Object processing routines:
	1) After being notified about recognized quadrilaterals, start to process them according described logic.
	2) Compute realtive size, coordinates, link object with required image to show.
	3) Notify GUI module about processed quadrilaterals, which are now replaced with virtual objects, representing
	physical objects.

Object display routines:
	1) After being notified, start to display virtua objects one by one
